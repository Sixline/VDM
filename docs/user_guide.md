about FireDM, thanks to Ashwin @ ghacks.net


FireDM is an open source download manager that can download videos and
playlists, written in Python.

The interface of FireDM has four tabs, The Main tab is used to add new
downloads. The program captures downloads from the clipboard, but you
can manually start a download by pasting a URL in the Link box.

When FireDM recognizes that the clipboard contains a link to a
downloadable file, it displays its interface. To be precise, the Main
tab is brought to focus. It displays the captured link, the name of the
file, its size, type (ZIP, EXE, etc), and whether the download can be
resumed or not.

Want to download videos? You can, copy the URL or paste it manually in
the link box and FireDM will pull up options to download the media. It
allows you to choose the videos to download, the video format and
resolution

## Using cookies with FireDM:

Passing cookies to FireDM is a good way to work around CAPTCHA, some websites require you to solve in particular
cases in order to get access (e.g. YouTube, CloudFlare).

you need to extract cookie file from your browser save it some where (for example: cookies.txt) then goto
Settings > Network > then check Use Cookies option
browse to select your cookies file ... done.

In order to extract cookies from browser use any conforming browser extension for exporting cookies.
For example, [cookies.txt](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookiestxt/njabckikapfpffapmjgojcnbfjonfjfg) (for Chrome)
or [cookies.txt](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/) (for Firefox)

Note that the cookies file must be in Mozilla/Netscape format and the first line of the cookies file must be either
`# HTTP Cookie File or # Netscape HTTP Cookie File`.
Make sure you have correct newline format in the cookies file and convert newlines if necessary to correspond with your OS,
namely CRLF (\r\n) for Windows and LF (\n) for Unix and Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS, etc.).
HTTP Error 400: Bad Request when using cookies is a good sign of invalid newline format.
